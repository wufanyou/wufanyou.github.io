Post doc <br/>
Department of Forestry and Natural Resources <br/>
Purdue University <br/>

I am Fanyou Wu, and I am a postdoc at Purdue University. I receive a Ph.D. degree in Forestry from [Department of Forestry and Natural Resources, Purdue University](https://fnr.purdue.edu/)(2021). Before attending Purdue, I received my master's degree from [University of Eastern Finland](https://www.uef.fi/en/etusivu) (2018) and bachelor's degree from [Nanjing Forestry University](http://eng.njfu.edu.cn) (2015) both in Wood Material Science. I was also an exchange student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) (2013).  

My research focuses on applying machine learning to forest-related problems, e.g., wood identification through image recognition. Attending machine learning related [competitions](/competition) is my side interests, and I have won many championships and runners-up in machine learning related competitions and top conference competitions at KDD, IJCAI, NeurIPS, and CVPR.
