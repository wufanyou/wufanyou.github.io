Graduate Research Assistant <br/>
Department of Forestry and Natural Resources <br/>
Purdue University <br/>

I am Fanyou Wu, currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) from the [Forestry and Natural Resources Department](https://fnr.purdue.edu/). Before attending Purdue, I received my master degree from [University of Eastern Finland](https://www.uef.fi/en/etusivu) (2018) and bachelor degree from [Nanjing Forestry University](http://eng.njfu.edu.cn) (2015) both in Wood Material Science. I was also an exchange student in the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) (2013). Now my research focuses on applying machine learning to forest-related problems e.g., wood identication through image recognization.

Attending machine learning related [competitions](/competitions) is my side interesting, and I have won many championships and runners-up in machine learning related competitions and top conference competation like KDD/IJCAI/NeurIPS etc. Now I am ranking 11th in [Tianchi Competition Platform](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/home/?lang=en-us) held by Alibaba Company with nickname 铁球.
