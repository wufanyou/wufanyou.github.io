title: Our tree diameter measurement and species identification App is under under testing.

#### The App
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-7">
        <b> Some facts for the current App </b>
        <br> <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently, we named our App as <b>Digital Forest</b>. </li>
            
            <br>
            <li>We achieved a <b>1 cm</b> mean absolute error (MAE) for tree diameter measurement.
                <ul>
                    <li>We are working on dealing with irregular shape of trees and camera rotations </li>
                </ul>
             </li>
             <br>
            <li>Our goal is to reach at least <b>90% accuracy</b> for common North American hardwood species identification.
                <ul>
                    <li>We are working on collecting a vast bark image database for North American hardwood species.</li>
                    <li>Currently, we reach a <b>Appx. 75% accuracy</b> for 22 different North American hardwood Species when the camera distance is <b>less than 1 meters</b> from the bark</li>
                    <li>We are improving the accuracy and making the classification model more suitable for the camera distance from 0.5 m to 3 m, a diameter measurement distance. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
