#### The App
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-7">
        <b> Some facts for the current App </b>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently, we named our App as <b>Digital Forest</b>. </li>
            <li>We aim to reach a <b>1 cm</b> mean absolute error (MAE) for tree diameter measurement.
                <ul>
                    <li>This goal is already achieved during the field test.</li>
                    <li>We are working on improving the stability of the results for some extreme cases.</li>
                </ul>
             </li>
            <li>Our goal is to reach at least <b>90% Accuracy</b> for common North American hardwood species identification.
                <ul>
                    <li>We are working on collecting a vast bark image database for North American hardwood species.</li>
                    <li>Currently, we reach a appx. 85% accuracy for 23 different North American hardwood Species in the computer.</li>
                    <li>The field test result will come soon.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
