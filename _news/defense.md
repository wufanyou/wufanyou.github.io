##### Introduction

<!-- Current lumber scanners, used in industrial wood manufacturing plants, such as rough mills and flooring plants, are used to measure and evaluate the quality and optimize processing of solid wood (Gazo et al. 2018; Wells et al. 2018). Because wood species differ significantly in their color, grain structure, natural characteristics, defects, and density, the scanner sensors often need to be calibrated for each species for their optimal performance. When production switches from one species to another one, the scanner settings must often be manually set. In this study, we attempt to automate the species identification based on image recognition so that the manufacturing equipment can automatically adapt to species being processed or even be able to process batches of mixed species.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep learning architecture inspired by the natural visual perception mechanism of the living creatures. Lecun et al. (1998) developed a multi-layer neural network called LeNet-5, which could classify handwritten digits from the MNIST data-set. Recent CNNs are comprised of groups of convolutional, pooling, activation, and fully-connected linear functions, and they include hundreds of thousands of connections (Goodfellow et al. 2016). Batch Normalization (BN) and Dropout layers are often applied in the training phase. BN can speed up the training, while Dropout is a regularization tool that can mitigate overfitting (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015; Srivastava et al. 2014). There are many CNN architectures. Among them ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet-V2 are commonly used (Huang et al. 2017; He et al. 2016; Sandler et al. 2018). ResNet first introduced residues connections, which can help in reducing the problem of accuracy becoming saturated and then degrading rapidly with increasing network depth. DenseNet improves the short-cut mechanism, connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. MobileNet-V2 was designed to reduce network parameters for real-time utilization for portable devices.

Researchers often treat wood classification as a texture classification task. Gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), local binary pattern (LBP), and gabor filters are popular techniques for the analysis of textures and pattern discrimination (Haralick et al. 1973; Ojala et al. 1996; Olshausen and Field 1996). Paula Filho et al. (2014) compared those techniques combined with a support vector machine to classify 41 Brazilian forest species based on cross section images. Other techniques for wood identification through macroscopic images have also been proposed (e.g., Alfonso et al. 1989 Martins et al. 2013 Ravindran et al. 2018). However, most of the wood identification studies are based on the clean-cut cross section and follow human expert knowledge. This approach may hinder the real industry application where longitudinal sections are commonly found and surfaces are rough (see Sect. Data pre-processing. Recent research in computer vision has shown that CNNs can learn texture instead of shape (Geirhos et al. 2019). Since images of the longitudinal section of boards contain almost all low-frequency texture features, applying CNNs to these images is an obvious choice for species detection. In this work, CNNs were applied to images of longitudinal lumber sections to develop an industrial application for wood species classification. -->
